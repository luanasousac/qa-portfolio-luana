# QA Portfolio – Manual Testing

This repository contains my Quality Assurance (QA) portfolio, focused on manual testing and quality validation of web applications.

The projects were structured to simulate real-world QA activities in a corporate environment, covering test planning, execution, bug reporting, exploratory testing, and regression testing.

## About Me

I am a QA Analyst focused on manual testing, functional validation, and user experience quality.

I bring a strong analytical mindset, attention to detail, and a business-oriented perspective to the QA process.  
Currently, I am expanding my skills in test automation using Cypress.
